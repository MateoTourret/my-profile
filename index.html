	            <h2>American Football üèà</h2>
	            <p>Since my childhood i always knew what was american football. In fact my father played americna football in france and i practiced too until the last year within the "Dragon de Paris's team" (for approximately 2 years).  nowadays i just watch it on the TV but still like it.

	            <h2>Journey üõ´</h2>
	            <p>I need to move. What I want to tell is than i need to see landscape more things than within my daily life. In my opinion the life is something than give to us the opprtunity to discover new thing each day of your whole of your life. Also that's why I chose EMLV, because i see there the oppurtunity to discover new think witihn the other country during my third year and maybe have the oppurtunity to work into other country in my future profesional's life
